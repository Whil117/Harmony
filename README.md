# Harmony

The goal of this project is to create a design editor that utilizes artificial intelligence to enhance the user's experience when designing and creating digital products. The editor will have a wide range of design tools, similar to those found in Figma, but with the incorporation of AI algorithms to expedite and improve the design process.

One of the main features of this editor will be its ability to offer real-time design recommendations based on the user's preferences and current design trends. The AI will analyze the user's previous designs, preferences, and current design trends to offer suggestions and solutions in real-time, reducing the time and complexity of the design process.

In addition, the editor will also have automation tools, allowing users to generate complex designs with just a few clicks. For example, the AI could recognize patterns in the design and automatically generate similar styles and elements, or even create entire designs based on user-provided information.
