Harmony offers an innovative solution for React projects that require image editing, PDF creation, and dynamic web design capabilities, similar to popular tools like Figma, Adobe XD, and Adobe Photoshop. Harmony is an open-source project specifically designed for React developers, using React Konva and Styled Components as its foundation. Importantly, Harmony is not a paid library or product. It allows each developer to customize it to fit their specific needs at no additional cost.

If you need create elements more quickly. you can use the keyboard shortcuts for improve your experience

I have plans to migrate harmony to a language native such C# for more flexibility and provide a best experience. But I'm developemnt harmony with reactjs because there aren't support for integrate in other projects.

And provide a support to differents methods of export such images, pdfs, .xls or web designs.
